 * [ ] Implement named capture groups support  
 * [ ] Add pattern composition for building complex patterns  
 * [ ] Add pattern explanation/visualization  
 * [ ] Add support for pattern negation  

#### Performance Improvements 🚀:
 * [ ] Optimize regex compilation process  
 * [ ] Add support for large input handling  
 * [ ] Implement pattern optimization before compilation  
 * [ ] Add memory usage optimization for large patterns  

#### Security Enhancements 🔐:
