# SimpleRegex.php Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines suggested improvements, optimizations, and security enhancements for the `SimpleRegex.php` library.

## 1. Security Enhancements

- **Improve ReDoS Protection:** The current `isValid()` method is a good start but can be bypassed. A more comprehensive validation mechanism is needed to prevent Regular Expression Denial of Service attacks. This includes disallowing nested quantifiers and complex character classes that can lead to catastrophic backtracking.
- **Stricter Input Sanitization:** All public-facing methods should rigorously validate and sanitize input parameters to prevent injection of malicious patterns.
- **Secure Error Handling:** Avoid using the `@` operator to suppress errors, as it can hide underlying issues. Instead, use `preg_last_error()` and `preg_last_error_msg()` to handle regex-related errors gracefully.

## 2. Optimizations

- **Performance-Tuned Caching:** While a cache is implemented, its key generation can be optimized. Using a faster hashing algorithm like `md5` or `sha1` for cache keys will improve performance for complex patterns.
- **Efficient Pattern Compilation:** The `compilePattern()` method can be optimized by reducing the number of `preg_replace` calls. Combining multiple replacements into a single pass will reduce overhead.
- **Streamlined Method Calls:** Consolidate redundant `preg_match` calls within the `isValid()` method to reduce unnecessary processing.

## 3. Code Quality and Readability

- **Method Refactoring:** Break down large, complex methods like `compilePattern()` and `processWildcards()` into smaller, single-purpose functions to improve maintainability and readability.
- **Consistent Coding Standards:** Adopt a consistent coding style and adhere to modern PHP standards. This includes standardizing the use of static vs. instance methods and clarifying the minimum required PHP version.
- **Improved Documentation:** Enhance DocBlocks and inline comments to provide clearer explanations of the code's logic, especially for complex regex manipulations.

## 4. New Feature Suggestions

- **Fluent Interface:** Implement a fluent (chainable) interface to make pattern building more intuitive and expressive.
- **Expanded Pattern Aliases:** Add more predefined patterns for common use cases, such as credit card numbers, international phone numbers, and additional date/time formats.
- **Named Capture Group Support:** Introduce helper methods to simplify working with named capture groups in match results.
- **Replacement Functionality:** Add a `replace()` method to support `preg_replace`-style search-and-replace operations.
