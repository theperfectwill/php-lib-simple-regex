- **Less Error-Prone**: Minimize common regex mistakes with built-in validation

### 2. Improved Performance
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatic pattern caching for repeated use
- **Optimized Compilation**: Efficient pattern processing and compilation
- **Reduced Overhead**: Lower memory footprint compared to raw regex in many use cases

### 3. Enhanced Security
- **Built-in Protection**: Guard against ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks
- **Safe Pattern Handling**: Automatic escaping and validation of patterns
- **Controlled Execution**: Time and resource limits for pattern matching

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear examples and API references
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Understandable error messages for easier debugging
- **IDE Support**: Full PHPDoc annotations for better code completion

## ✨ Key Features

### Pattern Features
- **Preset Patterns**: Common patterns like emails, URLs, and IP addresses
- **Pattern Aliases**: Use simple aliases like `@email` instead of complex regex
- **Pattern Composition**: Build complex patterns by combining simpler ones
- **Unicode Support**: Full support for UTF-8 and multibyte characters

### Performance Features
- **Smart Caching**: Configurable caching system for compiled patterns
- **Lazy Compilation**: Patterns are compiled only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large patterns and inputs

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Built-in validation for untrusted patterns
- **Complexity Analysis**: Detect potentially problematic patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through configurable rate limits

### Usability Features

## 📊 Comparison with Native PHP Regex

| Feature | SimpleRegex | Native PHP Regex |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Readability | High (intuitive syntax) | Low (complex patterns) |
| Performance | Optimized with caching | Raw performance |
| Security | Built-in protections | Manual implementation |
| Maintenance | Easier to update | Harder to maintain |
| Learning Curve | Gentle | Steep |
| Debugging | Helpful error messages | Cryptic errors |
| Code Reuse | Built-in patterns | Manual implementation |

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Ideal for:
- Form validation
- Data extraction
- Text processing
- Input sanitization
- Log analysis
- Data transformation
- Content filtering
- URL routing

## 🚀 Getting Started

```php
use ThePerfectWill\PhpLib\SimpleRegex;

// Simple email validation
$isValid = (new SimpleRegex('@email'))->doesMatch('user@example.com');

// Extract URLs from text
$text = 'Visit https://example.com or http://test.org';
$urls = [];
$regex = new SimpleRegex('@url');
if ($regex->doesMatch($text, $matches)) {
    $urls = $matches[0];
}
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Cache Wisely**: Reuse SimpleRegex instances when possible
- **Use Presets**: Leverage built-in patterns for better performance
- **Profile**: Always test with realistic data volumes
- **Monitor**: Keep an eye on memory usage with large inputs
